# Deprecated

The newer [live data](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) offers a better solution to this problem. If you're interested in using rx with live data, you can checkout the [live data from reactive streams api](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/lifecycle/LiveDataReactiveStreams.html)

[ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/kmdupr33/RxLoader/com.philosophicalhacker.rxloader%3Arxloader/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/kmdupr33/RxLoader/com.philosophicalhacker.rxloader%3Arxloader/_latestVersion)

# RxLoader

`compose()` your `Observable`s and `Single`s into ones that load data that's cached across activity orientation changes without leaking your `Activity` and without you having to worry about unsubscribing.

RxLoader accomplishes this by building on top of [Android Loaders](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/loaders.html), so the library is super lightweight (only defines 47 methods).

There's a lot of data loading solutions already for Android. I detail why I felt we needed another one [here](http://www.philosophicalhacker.com/post/rxloader-boilerplate-free-data-loading-with-loaders-and-rxjava)

## Code

Github repo is [here](https://github.com/kmdupr33/RxLoader). Note that it contains [some rough sample code](https://github.com/kmdupr33/RxLoader/tree/master/sample).

## Javadoc

[Here](https://www.philosophicalhacker.com/RxLoader/javadocs/index.html)

## Basic Usage

### build.gradle

```groovy
dependencies {
  compile 'com.philosophicalhacker.rxloader:rxloader:0.4.0'
}  
```

### FooActivity

```java
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    final RxLoader rxLoader = new RxLoader(this, getSupportLoaderManager());
    storyApiService
        .getAskStories()
        .compose(rxLoader.<List<Integer>>makeSingleTransformer())
        .subscribe(new Consumer<List<Integer>>() {
          @Override public void accept(List<Integer> integers) {
            Log.d(TAG, "call() called with: integers = [" + integers + "]");
          }
        });
}
```

Notice that you don't have worry about calling `subscribeOn` or `observeOn` either. That's handled by RxLoader.
